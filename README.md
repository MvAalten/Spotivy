4- End-of-day commit after a lesson or after you're finished working on your own time. If your feature is ready, commit it to the develop branch for review by others. If you are still working on it, commit to your local branch.

5- Review merge conflicts together: Ensure we donâ€™t accidentally skip anything important.

6- You are not allowed to merge your own pull requests: This should always be done by another person.

7- If one is absent while having a task, they will finish that same task in their own time to avoid falling behind sprints.
